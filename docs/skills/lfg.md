# `lfg`

> Run the full hands-off engineering pipeline from planning through a green PR.

`lfg` is the **autonomous pipeline** skill. It chains the main Compound Engineering workflow into one long-running run: plan the work, implement it, simplify the result, review it, apply eligible review fixes, run browser tests, commit, push, open a PR, then watch CI and repair failures within a bounded loop.

Use it when you want the full agentic shipping path and are comfortable with the agent taking the work from a feature description to an open PR. It is best after `/ce-brainstorm`, because the pipeline can then plan against real requirements instead of a one-line prompt.

## TL;DR

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What does it do? | Runs the full CE software pipeline from planning through PR and CI watch |
| When to use it | Software tasks that are ready for autonomous implementation |
| What it produces | Code changes, commits, usually a PR, and durable residual notes when something cannot be fully resolved |
| What's next | Review the PR, merge when ready, and run `/ce-compound` if there is reusable learning to capture |
| Distinguishing | Hard ordering gates, implementation-only cross-model routing, return-to-caller execution, review-fix persistence, browser test pass, bounded CI autofix loop |

## The Problem

The normal CE workflow is deliberately staged: plan, work, simplify, review, ship. That is useful when you want to inspect each step, but too much handoff when the task is well-bounded and you want the agent to carry the whole thing.

Without an explicit pipeline, autonomous runs tend to skip planning, treat review as optional, forget to persist residual findings, or stop at "PR opened" while CI is still red.

## The Solution

`lfg` makes the sequence explicit and gated:

- Step 1 composes a transient settled-decisions brief from the conversation — each decision with its class, rejected alternative, and reason, topically scoped to the feature — and passes it to `/ce-plan` so decisions the user already made are carried, not re-asked; the brief is skipped entirely when nothing is settled
- `/ce-plan` must produce an implementation-ready code plan before work starts
- `/ce-work` runs in return-to-caller mode so the pipeline regains control after implementation; a requested implementation target is carried only across this seam
- Behavior-changing implementation must return verification evidence from `/ce-work`; if evidence is missing, `lfg` retries `/ce-work` once for evidence completion and then stops blocked rather than shipping blind
- `/ce-simplify-code` runs before review unless the change is docs-only or trivial
- `/ce-code-review` reports findings, then `lfg` applies eligible fixes and commits them
- Residual review findings are made durable in the PR body or a fallback tracked file
- `/ce-test-browser` runs in pipeline mode
- `/ce-commit-push-pr mode:pipeline branding:on` ships remaining changes when a remote exists and explicitly marks the CE provenance
- CI is watched for up to three repair iterations on an open PR
- An invalidating settlement conflict surfaced by planning or review halts the pipeline before shipping rather than quietly overriding what was agreed; non-halting flagged conflicts become durable residuals that reach the PR body

The pipeline also has a local-only path: if the repository has no git remote, it commits locally and skips push, PR creation, and CI watch instead of retrying impossible network steps.

## When to Reach For It

Reach for `lfg` when:

- You have a software task that can be taken through plan, implementation, review, and PR
- You want hands-off progress while preserving CE's quality gates
- The task is already shaped by `/ce-brainstorm` or is clear enough for `/ce-plan` to turn into an implementation-ready plan
- You want CI failures handled automatically within a bounded loop

Skip `lfg` when:

- The work is non-software or answer-seeking
- You need interactive product shaping before implementation -> `/ce-brainstorm`
- You want to inspect and approve each stage manually -> run `/ce-plan`, `/ce-work`, `/ce-code-review`, and `/ce-commit-push-pr` yourself
- The repo has unusual shipping requirements that need hand-driven git or release work

## Use as Part of the Workflow

```text
/ce-brainstorm describe the feature
/lfg
```

Starting with `/ce-brainstorm` gives the pipeline better requirements. `lfg` then invokes `/ce-plan` itself and stops if the resulting plan is not an implementation-ready code plan.

You can also invoke it directly:

```text
/lfg add account-level notification mute settings
```

Direct invocation is useful for clear software tasks, but it gives the planner less product context.

## Route Only the Implementation Stage

You may ask `lfg` to have another model or harness author implementation while `lfg` keeps ownership of planning, review, PR creation, and CI:

```text
/lfg use Codex for implementation; add account-level notification mute settings
/lfg implement the settled plan, but only use Composer for implementation
```

`lfg` recognizes the intent from the whole instruction rather than matching one keyword. It removes that routing direction from the product request before planning, then carries a transient object containing exactly `mode`, `target`, `model`, and `source` beside `mode:return-to-caller` only when it invokes `ce-work`. On string-only hosts that seam is `mode:return-to-caller implementation_engine:<compact-json> <plan-path>`; for example, `implementation_engine:{"mode":"prefer","target":"codex","model":null,"source":"lfg-current-turn"}`. The object never becomes plan content, a settled product decision, or review input. A plain mention of a model in feature text, quoted material, a comparison, or a filename does not activate routing.

The first example is preference-strength. If the Codex route is unavailable before work starts, `ce-work` implements natively and returns the requested route, actual route/model, and fallback reason; `lfg` discloses the fallback and continues to its one shipping tail. The second is requirement-strength. Because `lfg` is headless, an unavailable required route blocks without asking or silently switching to native work.

Target `cursor` means the Cursor harness with its configured default model. Target `composer` means a Composer-family model requested through Cursor. A model pin is optional. Route substitution stays within the requested target/model family and is disclosed; a route is not used until its fixed-recipient, unattended write adapter is qualified and locally available. The cross-model engine has a launch floor of at least one real non-native route passing that qualification matrix; failing candidates remain unavailable rather than becoming guessed production commands.

When the prompt has no implementation instruction, `lfg` passes no empty binding. `ce-work` then resolves the gitignored per-checkout `work_engine_mode`, `work_engine_target`, and optional `work_engine_model` settings. Config `prefer` is active in the automatic flow; config `require` blocks if unavailable. A current-turn implementation instruction outranks that config.

Long external runs remain observable through the `ce-work` return contract: run id, requested and actual identity, unit/job state, activity and elapsed time, checkpoint, verification/commit state, blockers, and recovery path. If `lfg` retries once to reconcile missing verification evidence, it uses the same binding and run id; it does not dispatch implementation or run the shipping tail twice. See [`ce-work`](./ce-work.md#choose-the-implementation-author) for egress disclosure, private run state, detached-worktree containment, transactional fold-in, timeouts, resume/reap/cleanup, fallback, and parallel-wave behavior.

## Reference

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| _(empty)_ | Plans from current context, then runs the pipeline if the plan is eligible |
| `<feature description>` | Passes the description to `/ce-plan`, then runs the pipeline |
| `<feature description + implementation assignment>` | Removes the assignment from planning and carries it only to `ce-work` as `prefer` unless the instruction clearly requires the target |

Output: code changes, commits, and usually a PR. If there is no configured git remote, output is local commits only. If CI remains red after the bounded repair loop, unresolved failures are recorded durably before the run ends.
